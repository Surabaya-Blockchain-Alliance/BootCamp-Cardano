## Overview
This bootcamp is designed for anyone interested in building smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain using Aiken and Plutus. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, this program will provide you with hands-on experience through interactive workshops, collaborative projects, and engaging discussions. By the end of the bootcamp, you will be equipped to deploy your own smart contracts.

## Bootcamp Structure
- **Duration**: 4 Weeks
- **Format**: Combination of live sessions, recorded lectures, and hands-on workshops.
